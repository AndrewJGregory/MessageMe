# Frontend vs Backend User Search

There is conditional rendering when a user searches for other users. This occurred to me because when I search on Facebook Messenger for people, the search *seems* to display people that are my friends or recent people that I have chatted with *first*, then display other people that are lesser known to me after toward the bottom of the list. I'm not even sure if Messenger intends to do this (although I think this is a more pleasant UX because most of the time people search for their closest friends), I decided to emulate something like this. When the current user searches for users, the *front end state* is searched first. If there are results to display, then they are displayed. If there are no results, a helpful messages appears saying "Press enter to search". When enter is pressed, then the backend is searched for users and those users can now populate the front end state. If still *no users are found* after searching the backend, then a message is displayed "No users match your query" because there are no users that match the query at all.
