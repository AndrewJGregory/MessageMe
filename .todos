New user creates account. Messages someone. New user needs to 
show up in search results on the left.

Solution: stream chat_id, current_user, along with message with the chat channel. 
Populate accordingly. 

No need for search slice of state, move users to entities since filtering is 
done on the front end anyway
Initially fetch only the first ten users from database, keep it capped 
at ten users (or make the user search result scrollable)
