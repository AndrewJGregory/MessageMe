* New user creates account. Messages someone. New user needs to 
show up in search results on the left.

Solution: stream chat_id, current_user, along with message with the chat channel. 
Populate accordingly. 

* Initially populate user search results:
- Fetch the ten most recently messaged users on the backend
- If searched, populate the left with more results 
- Still need to fetch on the back AND front end who is most recently messaged

- Initial data is all fetched. Refresh page, everything is lost.
